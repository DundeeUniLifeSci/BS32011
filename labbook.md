## A git repository as a lab book

A well kept repository should have:
1. A README.md in every directory that includes a list of every file and a summary of what it does. In addition it may, where appropriate, include instructions on how to use the files (or point to a file which includes those instructions)
2. All code should be documented well. All classes and functions should have docstrings that describe how they are to be used and what values they return.
3. Tests for functions that show when/where they break.
4. Clear descriptive commits of a suitably atomic size (one significant set of changes per commit).
5. Use informative tags at appropriate key points to indicate a deliverable or milestone reached.

Your repository should guide you through the code and the reasoning behind it. This saves a lot of time when you want to update it or track down a bug.
