# Setup and login

The teaching server (ts-ug-dev.lifesci.dundee.ac.uk) has been set up with all the necessary software and systems to allow you to complete this practical.

You can work on this on your own machine but will need to ensure you have the [relevant software](software.md) installed.

## Logging in

You can either use XMing as per last year for the python programming (you will notice a slight change to the desktop as we have updated the machine) or PuTTY which can be found in the Internet and communications section. This gives you just one terminal (though you can then log in many times). The server name is **ts-ug-dev.lifesci.dundee.ac.uk** and you should use your normal username and login password. 

PuTTY, XMing and WinSCP are freely available for installation on your own machine

From a Mac/Linux you can log in via SSH from a terminal.

    ssh username@ts-ug-dev.lifesci.dundee.ac.uk

Please note that the login is only available from the Lifesci or University of Dundee network.	
	
## File transfer

From a campus PC or windows machine use WinSCP to connect, as per the 2nd year programming practical.
From a command line, use the following:

    scp user@ts-ug-dev.lifesci.dundee.ac.uk:path/to/remote/file localfile
	
You can swap the remote and local parts roudn to transfer in the other direction.

A better way to keep work in sync is to use version control with Git. This is covered in the first part of the practical.

### MySQL username/password

Dr Martin will give you these. Please ask him if you have not received it.

# Appropriate Use

You can use the teaching facility for any reasonable purpose. You will gather skills that will enable you to produce useful applications. Any use must fit within the University guidelines for IT use and you should not rely on any data being persistent.
